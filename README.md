# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

The capstone will build upon the knowledge you have gained in the course in order to build a decentralized housing product. 

# Contract Tests

`TestERC721Mintable.js` contains code to test the main functionality of the token we defined. The contract being 
tested in this file is `CustomERC721Token` in the `ERC721Mintable.sol` file. The tests show that:
- Contract can be deployed and mint tokens.
- Returns the correct supply of total tokens.
- Returns correctly the total balance of a given account.
- Returns correctly the URI for a given token.
- Can transfer tokens from one account to an other.

In addition, this file tests ownership related functionality of the contract:

- Tokens can only be mint by contract owner.
- Method correctly returns the address of the contract owner.

`TestSquareVerifier.js` contains code to test the functionality of the verifier contract generated by Zokrates. The contract being 
tested in this file is `Verifier` in the `Verifier.sol` file. The tests show that:

- Correctly verifies a correct proof.
- Correctly reject an incorrect proof. 
 
`TestSolnSquareVerifier.js` contains code to test the combined functionality of the combined `CustomERC721Token` and 
`Verifier` contracts. The contract being tested `SolnSquareVerifier` in the `SolnSquareVerifier.sol` file. In order 
to test this contract a `Verifier` contract needs to be first deployed and its deployment address used as input 
parameter for the `SolnSquareVerifier` contract. The tests show that:

- Combined contract can be deployed.
- New solution can be added.
- New tokens can be minted.
- It is not possible to mint new tokens using incorrect proofs.
- It is not possible to mint new tokens using proofs already used.

# OpenSea

These are the links to the minted and sold tokens. Minted was done using the contract owner address and purchases 
were done using a secondary account. The history of the tokens are also displayed in the links.
